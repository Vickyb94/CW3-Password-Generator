# Challenge-week-three- Password Generator
## Description
The idea behind this project is to generate random password with various array of characters with desired length. This project solves the problem of having to create a password by the user because the system generates it randomly and the randomness makes it more secure that when it is made up by the user. I learnt how to make variable of choices and I also got to practice using function and for loop.

## Usage
This project can be used by following the prompts displayed on the window and selecting options that apply until the desired length and password characteristics is achieved. There are alerts that pop up when the length inputed does not comply with the set conditions and also when no characters are selected according to the rules set in th code.
